# Multithreaded Low-Latency Messaging System

## Overview
The **Multithreaded Low-Latency Messaging System** is a high-performance, real-time messaging platform developed to enable seamless one-to-one and group communication. This project leverages modern technologies like **Node.js**, **WebSockets**, **Redis Pub/Sub**, and **Apache Kafka** to deliver low-latency and reliable messaging. It also incorporates **Cassandra** for offline message storage and uses **Nginx** for load balancing to ensure high availability and scalability.

## Features
- **Real-time Communication**: Supports one-to-one and group messaging using WebSockets.
- **Offline Storage**: Utilizes Cassandra to store messages for offline users.
- **Scalability**: Implements Redis Pub/Sub to scale WebSocket connections efficiently.
- **Message Queue**: Employs Apache Kafka to handle message queues and improve performance.
- **High Availability**: Load balancing with Nginx ensures consistent availability under high traffic.
- **Performance**: Achieved a 52% performance improvement through optimized message handling and queue processing.

## Architecture
The system architecture is designed to support low-latency messaging with the following components:

1. **Client**:
   - Communicates with the server using WebSockets for real-time messaging.
   
2. **Backend**:
   - Built with Node.js for handling WebSocket connections.
   - Uses Redis Pub/Sub for scalable WebSocket communication.
   - Kafka for managing message queues.

3. **Database**:
   - Cassandra for durable offline message storage.

4. **Load Balancer**:
   - Nginx to distribute traffic across multiple server instances.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the system locally:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- Redis
- Apache Kafka
- Cassandra
- Nginx

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```env
   REDIS_HOST=<redis-host>
   REDIS_PORT=<redis-port>
   KAFKA_BROKER=<kafka-broker>
   CASSANDRA_HOST=<cassandra-host>
   PORT=<application-port>
   ```

4. Start the services:
   - **Redis**: Follow the [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/) to start the Redis server.
   - **Kafka**: Start the Kafka broker using the [Kafka Quickstart Guide](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart).
   - **Cassandra**: Start the Cassandra database using the [Cassandra documentation](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/).
   - **Nginx**: Set up and start Nginx using your preferred configuration.

5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
- Use a WebSocket client (e.g., Postman or a browser-based client) to connect to the server.
- Send and receive messages in real time.

## Benchmarks
- Performance improved by **52%** through optimized WebSocket handling with Redis Pub/Sub and Kafka integration.
- The system supports high traffic with consistent low-latency communication.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend framework for real-time messaging.
- **WebSockets**: Protocol for low-latency, real-time communication.
- **Redis Pub/Sub**: To scale WebSocket communication.
- **Apache Kafka**: For efficient message queueing.
- **Cassandra**: For offline message storage.
- **Nginx**: For load balancing and high availability.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for user authentication and authorization.
- Implement end-to-end encryption for secure communication.
- Introduce monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for performance insights.
- Expand to support video and voice messaging.
